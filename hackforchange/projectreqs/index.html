    <h2>Skillsets To Expect</h2>

     <h2>Project Lead</h2>
      <p>Each project requires a project lead to see the project from start to finish, attending the 3-day event. It is okay for two people to collaboratively lead the team.</p> 
    
    <h2>Goals and Structure</h2>
    <p>The projects/proposals for the weekend should have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tangible goals that can be met by a team of 4-10 people over 2 full days of work</li>
      <li>Projects that use varied skills and expertise levels</li> 
      <li>Clearly articulated challenges and tangible goals – think ‘project in a box’ that is ready for execution</li>
      <li>Scalable goals to fit a team size between 4 and 10 people </li> </ul>
     
    <h2>Starting Status</h2>
    <p>Projects can be at different phases (ideation, testing a specific component, a few steps before launch, etc.) With that, structure the weekend’s project proposal so that new individuals can contribute to a specific goal or milestone.</p>
    
    <h2>Timeline</h2>
