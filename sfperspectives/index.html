    <h1> What is San Francisco Perspectives? </h1>
    <p> 
     San Francisco Perspectives is a group of regular San Francisco locals who want to test out websites, mobile apps, and other tools created by Code for San Francisco volunteers to help improve our city. Examples can be found on the Code for San Francisco Projects Page.</p>
    <p>Code for San Francisco is a growing community of "civic hackers" — technology developers, community developers, engaged citizens, and others who collaborate to develop tech-based solutions for civic needs.</p>

    <h1> How do I participate? </h1>

    <h1>FAQ</h1>

<div><b>Q:</b> What would I do as a San Francisco Perspectives participant?</div>
<div><b>A:</b> Code for America volunteers may contact you to help in one of the following ways:</div>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Large Group Sessions - Come to a group “testing” session at the Code for San Francisco Headquarters (or a public library or other community space). There you will join other San Francisco Perspectives participants to test out a website or other tech solution created by Code for San Francisco volunteers. They will speak with you about your experience and gather feedback to improve the tool.
    </li> 
    <li>
         Small Group Sessions - Come to Code for San Francisco Headquarters for a small informal discussion or brainstorming session with one of our project teams to share your perspectives on how to make their solution better.
    </li>
    <li>
        Community Needs Assessment - Take part in a focus group discussion about what civic needs you, a San Francisco local, have. Code for San Francisco volunteers will get ideas of how technology solutions may be able to help.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
