excerpt: Improve social service delivery through shared, open resource data.
project: open-referral
---

Agencies and organizations maintain many different community resource directories containing lists of human and social services available to those seeking help. These directories live in isolation of each other and suffer from similar challenges. There is no shared knowledge across directories, with each organization applying similar resources and effort against a shared issue--creating and maintaining comprehensive lists of community social services.

This is problematic as individuals seeking help are left to navigate confusing lists of resources that may or may not lead them to the right place. Social workers and other help providers must master multiple lists of competing information, making it hard to connect their clients to the relevant help. And community development initiatives are left paying for new research to understand the state of their community resources.

The City is one of the keepers of data regarding social service organizations. Some of this data exist trapped in internal contract management systems, as the City contracts with many community based organizations. Some of this data exist in City-maintained resource guides. Sometimes this data sits in a database just beyond the reach of the public, other times it sits in PDFs. 

Regardless of the source, the City has an opportunity to free these data so they can be published in consistent formats, easily accessible by those that will help build modern referral systems and deliver consistent, high quality social services to those in need. 

This project seeks to prototype applications and workflows for maintaining this data and delivering it in ways others can use it in making referrals. It does this by:

1. Transforming data from messy to standard
2. Prototyping tools to publish and maintain that data
