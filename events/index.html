      <h2>SF’s National Day of Civic Hacking</h2>
      <h4>Every June</h4>

      <p>The National Day of Civic Hacking is an international event for people to focus on improving their community. Thousands of people from around the world tackle civically-oriented projects around open data, disaster relief, mapping, safety and justice, economic development, and other topics. Urbanists, civic hackers, developers, designers, marketers, students, government staff, and passionate residents join together to collaborate on new solutions for our city.</p>
      <p>Code for San Francisco organizes our local National Day of Civic Hacking. Check out 2015’s projects and website. Stay tuned for more information soon with 2016’s event.</p>

    <h2>#Hack4Congress</h2>
    <h4>March 2015</h4>

    <p>#Hack4Congress events bring together designers, journalists, Congressional staffers, policy wonks, technologists, academics, and other experts for two days of intense collaboration. Our goal: to find creative ways Congress can become more effective, efficient, and open. Solutions can be policy changes, technology tools, or other innovations.</p>
    <p>Participants form teams around specific challenges. After two days of problem-solving, groups present their work to a panel of judges. The winning team from each event will share their work with members of Congress and their staffers in May.</p>
