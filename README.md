# CodeForSanFrancisco.org

The website for the Code for San Francisco Brigade

### Goals
1. Explain what Code for San Francisco is and the type of work we do.
2. To celebrate our events, projects, and discussions!
4. Encourage current and new members to participate with clear ways to get involved.
5. To have this site be easily reused by other Brigades just starting out.

### Tech

Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), and the [CfAPI](https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfapi).

## Contributing

### <a name="issues"></a>Submitting an Issue

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sfbrigade/sfbrigade.github.io/issues) to track bugs and features. We've included several of our open GitHub Issues right on our homepage using the [Civic Tech Issue Finder](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues). 


### Running the Site Locally on Your Computer

To run the site locally on your own computer (most helpful for previewing your own changes), you will need Jekyll installed ([click here for Jekyll installation instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).)

Fork and clone the repository, then run the following command in the root directory of the repo:

`jekyll serve`

or

`jekyll serve --watch` which will watch for changes to files.

Your computer should now be serving your local copy of the site at:

[http://0.0.0.0:4000](http://0.0.0.0:4000).

### Sharing Your Changes Using Jekit

You can use the nifty [Jekit](https://jekit.codeforamerica.org/) app to preview changes you make to this site.

To do this, fork this repo, and commit your changes on a branch to your fork. You can then preview what your changes look like by navigating to:

https://jekit.codeforamerica.org/USERNAME/sfbrigade.github.io/BRANCHNAME/

For a basic example of its usage, if GitHub user **@lolname** has made changes to the projects page on their fork (on the `master` branch), they can preview their changes using Jekit by going to:

https://jekit.codeforamerica.org/lolname/sfbrigade.github.io/master/projects
